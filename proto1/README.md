# Vue.js hello world examples.

There are three examples in this directory exploring htlm / css and basic vue.js samples

## Example 1: hello world 1

hello1.html is a single file that has the sample hello world from the [vue.js getting started guide](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/index.html) 
The example assumes that the vue.js script file has been downloaded and available in a local directory (./dist/vue.js). The
file also contains examples of using online versions.

The example is a stand-alone file that can be executed by opening it in a browser - there is no node.js,
webpack or other tooling required.

## Example 2: hello world 2

hello2.html is the same as hello1.html, but the vue.js is moved to a separate file, app.js.

## Mock-up

The files mock1.html and mock1.css contain a html only prototype of what an application
for monitoring Accumulo FATE transactions (the first goal application)

The css uses borders to help see the effect and placement of styling of the css.
